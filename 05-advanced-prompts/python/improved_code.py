# Here are three suggested improvements for your Flask application:

# Explicit Development Server Configuration: 
# When running the Flask development server, it's good practice to 
# explicitly set the host, port, and debug mode. This makes your 
# application's behavior more predictable during development and 
# allows external access if needed (e.g., from a VM or another 
# device on your network).

# Add Type Hinting: 
# Incorporating type hints improves code readability and allows 
# static analysis tools to catch potential errors early.

# Use Environment Variables for Configuration: 
# For settings like the port, it's better to use environment 
# variables. This allows for easier configuration in different 
# environments (development, staging, production) without code 
# changes.

from flask import Flask, request
import os  # Improvement 3: Import os

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello() -> str:  # Improvement 2: Add return type hint
    name: str = request.args.get('name', 'World')  # Improvement 2: Add variable type hint
    # Basic sanitization: ensure name is treated as a string.
    # For more complex scenarios, consider libraries like bleach for HTML sanitization.
    name = str(name)
    return f'Hello, {name}!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Improvement 1 & 3: Explicit configuration and use of environment variable for port
    host = '0.0.0.0'  # Makes the server accessible externally
    port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000))  # Use PORT environment variable or default to 5000
    debug = True  # Enable debug mode for development

    app.run(host=host, port=port, debug=debug)
